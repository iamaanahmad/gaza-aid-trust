# Gaza Aid & Trust: Presentation Deck

This is a 6-slide outline for your hackathon presentation. Copy and paste the content for each slide into your preferred presentation software (like Google Slides or PowerPoint).

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**(Visually, this slide should have your app logo and a powerful, hopeful background image.)**

### Gaza Aid & Trust: Crisis Connect

**An AI-powered triage and medical aid platform for Gaza.**

*A "Hack for Gaza" Submission*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem - A Disconnected Frontline

**(Use simple icons for each bullet point to make it visually scannable.)**

### The Problem: A Disconnected Frontline

*   **Overwhelmed Intake Process:** Manual, paper-based patient triage is slow, error-prone, and fails during mass casualty events.

*   **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** Medics have no central view of where the most urgent patients are, what specific supplies are needed, or which clinics are overwhelmed.

*   **Misinformation & Mistrust:** In a chaotic environment, unverified reports about clinic capacity or available resources can lead to fatal delays and wasted effort.

## Slide 3: Our Solution - Trust Through Technology

**(Showcase a clean screenshot of the Triage Map with an alert popup as the main visual.)**

### Our Solution: Gaza Aid & Trust

We built a Progressive Web App (PWA) that connects medics, aid, and donors through a system of **AI-verified trust**.

Our platform provides:
1.  **A Real-Time Triage Map** with hands-free, voice-powered alert submission.
2.  **An AI-Powered Trust Score** that uses community feedback to verify information.
3.  **A Direct Medical Aid Pipeline** connecting donor funds to specific, on-the-ground needs.

## Slide 4: Core Features

**(Use a three-column layout, with a clear icon and screenshot for each feature.)**

| Feature                   | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Voice-to-Text Triage**  | Medics can post geo-tagged alerts hands-free, in Arabic or English. The system auto-detects keywords like "urgent" to set priority.                |
| **AI Trust Score**        | To combat misinformation, a Gemini model calculates a "Trust Score" for each alert based on community confirmations and disputes.                    |
| **Direct Aid Connection** | A dedicated feed where clinics request specific supplies (e.g., insulin, bandages) and donors can fund them directly.                            |
| **Offline First (PWA)**   | As a PWA, the app caches critical map data and alerts, ensuring it remains functional even in low-connectivity environments.                       |

## Slide 5: The Tech Stack

**(Use logos for each technology for quick visual recognition.)**

### Tech Stack

*   **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
*   **UI**: React, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS
*   **AI**: Google Gemini via Firebase Genkit
*   **Database**: Cloud Firestore
*   **Mapping**: Mapbox
*   **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App (PWA)

## Slide 6: Future Roadmap & Vision

**(End on a hopeful and forward-looking note. Use simple, aspirational icons.)**

### Future Roadmap

*   **Phase 1: Strengthen Trust & Security**
    *   Implement phone number-based authentication for medics.
    *   Deploy AI for duplicate alert detection.

*   **Phase 2: Enhance Communication & Logistics**
    *   Build end-to-end encrypted chat between medics and donors.
    *   Integrate with NGO supply chains to track aid delivery.

*   **Phase 3: Predictive Analytics**
    *   Use AI to analyze trends and predict future areas of greatest need.

**Our Vision: A transparent, community-driven ecosystem where technology restores dignity and saves lives.**

**Thank You.**
